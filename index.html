                <h1>Women's Weird</h1>

                <p><span class="dropCap">O</span>n March 8, 2020, I picked up a copy of <em>Women's Weird</em> - an anthology by Melissa Edmundson of
                    Victorian ghost stories from women authors. Given the significance of the date (International
                    Women's Day), perhaps it was fitting that it caught my eye in the bookstore on that particular day.</p>

                <p> I didn't anticipate that I would immediately be compelled to dive into the genre more deeply, or
                    that this book would shape the perfect reading list against the backdrop of the strange times that were coming. A
                    week later when the global pandemic locked everything down, out of work and looking for a
                    good distraction, this book was the first one I picked up. The themes in this collection (and all
                    the writers that it subsequently led me to) became the perfect outlet to help cope with the strange,
                    surreal situation outside. The stories collected in this book led me to rediscover a genre I had
                    always enjoyed, and gave me the chance to explore its themes more deeply.</p>

                <p>The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/22/unquiet-spirits-the-lost-female-ghost-story-writers-returning-to-haunt-us">featured
                        an article</a> discussing this book, and its sequel that was released in October this year.</p>

                                produced was that of having in common one memory so deep and dark that nothing that
                                had happened since was worth either a growl or a wag."</p>

                                commanded me to come to him, as the eyes of the mesmeriser...I was ice-cold with fear
                                and horror, but—I <strong>felt</strong> myself going to him."</em></p>
