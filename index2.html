                <h1>Women's Weird</h1>

                <p>On March 8, 2020, I picked up a copy of <em>Women's Weird</em> - an anthology by Melissa Edmundson of Victorian ghost stories from women authors. Given the significance of the date (International Women's Day), perhaps it was fitting that it caught my eye in the bookstore that day.</p>

                <p> I didn't anticipate that I would immediately be compelled to dive into the genre more deeply, or that it would shape the perfect reading list against the backdrop of the strange times to come. A week later, when everything locked down due to the global pandemic, out of work and looking for a good distraction, this book was the first one I picked up. The themes in this collection (and all the writers that it subsequently led me to) became the perfect outlet to help cope with the strange, surreal situation outside. The stories collected in this book led me to rediscover a genre I had always enjoyed, and gave me the chance to explore more deeply several themes that feel relevant even a century later.</p>

                <p>The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/22/unquiet-spirits-the-lost-female-ghost-story-writers-returning-to-haunt-us">featured an article</a> discussing this book, and its sequel that was released in October this year.</p>

Their arms rose slowly, heavy with intolerable reluctance; they stretched them out towards each other, aching, as if they held up an overpowering weight. Their feet dragged and were drawn."</em></p>
